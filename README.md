# E-Commerce

## Description

Internet retail, also known as **e-commerce**, plays a significant role within the electronics industry, as it empowers businesses and consumers alike to conveniently engage in online buying and selling of electronic products. In the latest available data from 2021, the industry in the United States alone was estimated to have generated the substantial amount of US$2.54 trillion, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes.

This E-Commerce back end provides a company with a way to manage, sort and delete their products using tags and categories

## Notes
The original project outlined using Auto Increment in the tables, I believe I have a software issue where Auto Increment is not properly working in mysql. I tested old class repos as well and could not get Auto Increment to set any values. So I instead changed the seeds to include id's, however my first commits had the values set to Auto Increment before I made this change.
